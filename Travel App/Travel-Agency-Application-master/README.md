# Travel Agency Application

A simple Travel Agency Application with Java and Spring Boot.

## Installation

It's a Spring Boot `2.5.2` and Java `11` application with a very little functionality. Here are the commands you need to run one by one-

```
git clone git@github.com:CodeMechanix/Travel-Agency-Application.git
cd Travel-Agency-Application
mvn clean
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then you need to put your database credentials in the application-dev.yml file. I used PostgreSQL in this project. 

Then you can visit the base url in this url- `http://localhost:8090/v1`. 

## Uses

This application can be used both in logged in or logged out state. But for using the full potential, you should logged in.

This project has following features-

- Full fledged registration and login system
- Proper validation for each form
- Status Create, Update (With Public and Private Privacy).
- Location Master Data
- JWT 
- Global Exception Handling
- Added a test case. not covered all test cases here.
